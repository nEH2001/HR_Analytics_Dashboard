# HR_Analytics_Dashboard
This is a analytics project using SQL for storing and manipulating the data, and Power Bi for doing the visualization part.
In this project, I have loaded the raw data in SQL and tranformed it. Later, framed some questions, found out the answers and later got the insights using one of the best and in-trend visualization software, Power Bi.
